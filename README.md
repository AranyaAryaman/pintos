Pintos Projects of IIT Guwahati

Introduction

PintOS (Ben Pfaff et al) [http://pintos-os.org/SIGCSE2009-Pintos.pdf ] is a popular software used at
 many Universities – in India and overseas – to train students in the erudite internal details of the Unix41 like operating systems. The primary document that we use in this subject was originally written at the
 Stanford University [https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.pdf]. The Pint OS 

 document (we will refer to it as PintDoc) describes a set of four projects to be completed by the
 student teams under the Stanford model.
 The Stanford model does not fit our arrangements and we must adapt the model to fit into our
 resource constraints and timetable limitations. Overly hard training regime diverts the students from
 learning to mark-scoring mode.
 The original training model proposed by Ben Pfaff has four projects: Threads, User Programs, Virtual
 Memory, and File System. We adapt the model to our situation – we propose weekly sessions by
 splitting the projects into exercises. An IITG student aiming for a double-A grade (AA) must
 complete an exercise each week. Other students may improve their learning outcomes by progressing
 on these exercises at a slower pace to suit their learning objectives.
