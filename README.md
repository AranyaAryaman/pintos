Pintos Projects of IIT Guwahati

Introduction

PintOS (Ben Pfaff et al) [http://pintos-os.org/SIGCSE2009-Pintos.pdf ] is a popular software used at
40 many Universities – in India and overseas – to train students in the erudite internal details of the Unix41 like operating systems. The primary document that we use in this subject was originally written at the
42 Stanford University [https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs140/projects/pintos/pintos.pdf]. The Pint OS 
2 | P a g e
43 document (we will refer to it as PintDoc) describes a set of four projects to be completed by the
44 student teams under the Stanford model.
45 The Stanford model does not fit our arrangements and we must adapt the model to fit into our
46 resource constraints and timetable limitations. Overly hard training regime diverts the students from
47 learning to mark-scoring mode.
48 The original training model proposed by Ben Pfaff has four projects: Threads, User Programs, Virtual
49 Memory, and File System. We adapt the model to our situation – we propose weekly sessions by
50 splitting the projects into exercises. An IITG student aiming for a double-A grade (AA) must
51 complete an exercise each week. Other students may improve their learning outcomes by progressing
52 on these exercises at a slower pace to suit their learning objectives.
